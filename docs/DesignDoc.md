## Architecture and Design

This section describes the application architecture.

### Summary

The following Tiers/Layers diagram shows a high-level view of the webapp's architecture. 
**NOTE**: detailed diagrams are required in later sections of this document.
> _**[Sprint 1]** (Augment this diagram with your **own** rendition and representations of sample system classes, placing them into the appropriate Component box (blue rectangle) inside the corresponding Layer. Focus on what is currently required to support **Sprint 1 - Demo requirements**. Make sure to describe your design choices in the corresponding _**Tier Section**_ and also in the _**OO Design Principles**_ section below.)_

![The Tiers & Layers of the Architecture](architecture-tiers-and-layers.png)

The web application is built using the **Presentation**(frontend), **Application**(backend), **Data** tiered architecture. 

The Presentation (frontend) is a client‑side SPA built with Angular, using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript to deliver the user interface and handle all user interactions.

The Application (backend) tier exposes RESTful APIs, implements business logic, and uses repositories/DAOs to interact with the underlying Data tier for persistence.

The Data contains the mechanisms responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing the application’s data using low‑level storage systems.

Both the Application and Data tiers are implemented using Java and the Spring Framework, with details of their internal components provided below.


### Overview of User Interface

This section describes the web interface and flow; this is how the user views and interacts with the web application.
>_For the reference below, provide an initial draft image/sketch of possible layout of a mayor page of your User Interface and a brief description of the elements it contains **[Sprint 1]**_

![Replace with your First concept of a layout for a mayor page in the User Interface](draft-layout-ui.png)

### 
> _Provide a summary of the application's user interface.  Describe, from the user's perspective, the flow of the pages/navigation in the web application.
>  (Add low-fidelity mockups prior to initiating your **[Sprint 2]**  work so you have a good idea of the user interactions.) Eventually replace with representative screenshots of your high-fidelity results as these become available and finally include future recommendations improvement recommendations for your **[Sprint 4]** )_


### Presentation Tier
> _**[Sprint 4]** Provide a summary of the Presentation Tier UI of your architecture.
> Describe the types of components in the tier and describe their
> responsibilities.  This should be a narrative description, i.e. it has
> a flow or "story line" that the reader can follow._

> _**[Sprint 4]** You must  provide at least **2 sequence diagrams** as is relevant to a particular aspects 
> of the design that you are describing.  (**For example**, in a shopping experience application you might create a 
> sequence diagram of a customer searching for an item and adding to their cart.)
> As these can span multiple tiers, be sure to include the round-trip, starting at an HTTP request from the client-side (frontend), covering steps through the server-side (backend) and reaching data storage
> to help illustrate the end-to-end flow._

> _**[Sprint 4]** To effectively illustrate the system, you should include static **class diagrams**  where they are relevant to your design. Some additional guidance is provided below:_
 >* _Class diagrams apply to the **Application** tier and more specifically within its relevant **Layers**._
>* _A single class diagram of the entire system will not be effective. You may start with one, but will need to break it down into smaller sections to account for requirements of each of the Layer's static models below._
 >* _Correct labeling of relationships with proper notation for the relationship type, multiplicities, and navigation information will be important._
 >* _Include other details such as attributes and method signatures that you think are needed to support the level of detail in your discussion._

### Application Tier
> _**[Sprint 4]** Provide a summary of this tier of your architecture. This
> section will follow the same instructions that are given for the Presentation
> Tier above._
> 
#### API Layer
> _**[Sprint 1, 4]** Provide a summary of this architectural layer._
>
> _**[Sprint 1, 2, 3]** List the classes supporting this layer and provide a brief description of their purpose._
> 
> _At appropriate places as part of this narrative provide **one** or more updated and **properly labeled**
> static models (UML class diagrams) with some details such as associations (connections) between classes, and critical attributes and methods. (**Be sure** to revisit the Static **UML Review Sheet** to ensure your class diagrams are using correct format and syntax.)_
>

#### Business Layer
> _**[Sprint 1, 4]** Provide a summary of this architectural layer._
>
> _**[Sprint 1, 2, 3]** List the classes supporting this layer and provide a brief description of their purpose._

> _At appropriate places as part of this narrative provide **one** or more updated and **properly labeled**
> static models (UML class diagrams) with some details such as associations (connections) between classes, and critical attributes and methods. (**Be sure** to revisit the Static **UML Review Sheet** to ensure your class diagrams are using correct format and syntax.)_

> _**[Sprint 1, 4]** Provide a summary of this architectural layer._
>
> _**[Sprint 1, 2, 3]** List the classes supporting this layer and provide a brief description of their purpose._

> _At appropriate places as part of this narrative provide **one** or more updated and **properly labeled**

### Data Tier
> _**[Sprint 1, 4]** Provide a summary of this tier of your architecture. This
> section will follow the same instructions that are given for the Presentation
> Tier above._
> 
## OO Design Principles

> _**[Sprint 1]** Name and describe the initial OO Principles that your team has considered in support of your design (and implementation) for this first Sprint._

> _**[Sprint 2, 3 & 4]** Will eventually address up to **4 key OO Principles** in your final design. Follow guidance in augmenting those completed in previous Sprints as indicated to you by instructor. Be sure to include any diagrams (or clearly refer to ones elsewhere in your Tier sections above) to support your claims._

> _**[Sprint 3 & 4]** OO Design Principles should span across **all tiers.**_

## Static Code Analysis/Future Design Improvements
> _**[Sprint 4]** With the results from the Static Code Analysis exercise, 
> **Identify 3-4** areas within your code that have been flagged by the Static Code 
> Analysis Tool (SonarQube) and provide your analysis and recommendations.  
> Include any relevant screenshot(s) with each area._

> _**[Sprint 4]** Discuss **future** refactoring and other design improvements your team would explore if the team had additional time._

## Testing
> _This section will provide information about the testing performed
> and the results of the testing._

### Acceptance Testing
> _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Report on the number of user stories that have passed all their
> acceptance criteria tests, the number that have some acceptance
> criteria tests failing, and the number of user stories that
> have not had any testing yet. Highlight the issues found during
> acceptance testing and if there are any concerns._

### Unit Testing and Code Coverage
> _**[Sprint 4]** Discuss your unit testing strategy. Report on the code coverage
> achieved from unit testing of the code base. Discuss the team's
> coverage targets, why you selected those values, and how well your
> code coverage met your targets._

>_**[Sprint 2, 3 & 4]** **Include images of your code coverage report.** If there are any anomalies, discuss
> those._

## Ongoing Rationale
>_**[Sprint 1, 2, 3 & 4]** Throughout the project, provide a time stamp **(yyyy/mm/dd): Sprint # and description** of any _**mayor**_ team decisions or design milestones/changes and corresponding justification._
